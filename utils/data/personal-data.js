I enjoy solving problems, building user-friendly web applications, and constantly learning new technologies. I’m comfortable working across the full stack, but my core strength lies in back-end development using Laravel. I love creating clean, secure, and efficient systems that make life easier for users. I’m always open to opportunities that match my skills and allow me to grow as a developer.",
